# Pineapple IIc

## Congratulations!

Youâ€™ve got the latest version of Pineapple Computer named _Pineapple IIc._ But what is Pineapple Computer? Well, it is a MIDI computer that can covert analog signals to MIDI (digital) signal. Now you may want to ask, I guess, what is it for? The Pineapple Computer is an artist-friendly super-easy-to-use computer! You plug power, sensor, MIDI instrument, and boom! Everything is set up.

### Non-basic usage

You can drive a relay, I2C devices, and TLC5940 PWM driver by installing some other components on Pineapple IIc. Also you can replace some connectors so that you can use panel mounted connectors and install Pineapple IIc board in a case. For more detail, please read _Extending Pineapple IIc_.

## How to set up (Software)

Install _Pineapple IIc Basic_ sketch to run Pineapple IIc in _Basic_ mode.

## How to play

Connect the following plugs.

* DC---Supply DC 12V to DC Jack connector.
* MIDI---Connect Pineapple IIc's MIDI OUT and your instrument's MIDI IN.
* Sensors---To be written.
